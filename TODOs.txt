STRUCTURE
1) Tokenization
  - class based as it is now
  - 
  - add line obj to each token instance for tracebacks
  - line object will not have much other use, apart from remembering comments
    + will refer strictly to the parsed source code lines (as is now)
  - result = one big list of tokens for the whole source code, newline is also a token
2) Parsing
  - there will not be a stack based loop
  - there will be a recursive approach instead
  - origin = method called in the program object
  - parser objects deriving from Node will parse their subtrees
