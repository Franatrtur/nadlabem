DONE - allow comments on if statement rows
done - keep original comments on translated lines even if generate_mapping is false
DONE - uppercase instructions

done - make variablelexer a subclass of instructionlexer
done - improve custom errors, erase error trace if not config.devmode
done - use custom errors when throwing expected exceptions (things that COULD happen)

extract components into separate reusable functions that return string list
 - (a function like load_var_to_register(register, label))
 - specifically component like compare_var_gt_literal(label, literal)
    would for example return a series of instructions that would leave 0 or not0 or the A register maybe?
    we can then use a simple JZ/JNZ

merge the if_var_eq and if_var_literal_eq thanks to these components
use these components, make the while lexer
