!! extract all literals to variables. halo pane
allow comments on if statement rows
add option to ignore unrecognized syntax (an unexpected sequence of tokens like !db<({ or if(){{ will be ignored)

make variablelexer a subclass of instructionlexer
improve custom errors, erase error trace if not config.devmode
use custom errors when throwing expected exceptions (things that COULD happen)

extract components into separate reusable functions that return string list
 - (a function like load_var_to_register(register, label))
 - specifically component like compare_var_gt_literal(label, literal)
    would for example return a series of instructions that would leave 0 or not0 or the A register maybe?
    we can then use a simple JZ/JNZ

merge the if_var_eq and if_var_literal_eq thanks to these components
use these components, make the while lexer
